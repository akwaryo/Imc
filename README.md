### About the IMC

Body mass index (IMC) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.
The index is calculated by the formula:

`weight / (height * height)`

The condition used to classify the index was accordingly to NHANES II (National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey). The following criteria was used:

Condition | Men Index | Woman Index
----------|-----------|------------
below weight | <20.7 | <19.1
normal weigt | 20.7 - 26.4 | 19.1 - 25.8
slight overweight | 26.5 - 27.8 | 25.9 - 27.3
overweight |27.9 - 31.1 | 27.4 - 32.3
